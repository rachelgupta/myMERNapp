This project is a simple MongoDB, Node and Express App. 

It performs CRUD operations on a user database created on mongoDB.
This gives - 
1. Read all users
2. Post a user
3. Read a user by Id
4. Delete a user by Id
5. Patch a user by Id

All these CRUD operations can be checked using Postman as there is no UI as of now.
This completes my learning for MongoDB - schema and model prepare, Express - easier html routes and middlewares, Node, CRUD operations, API calling, async functions and clean folder structure using model-view-controller.
